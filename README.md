# yogurty

yogurty is an Emacs package I'm putting together from functions I've
written that work on RT tickets and Orgmode.  Partly it could be
useful for someone else, partly it'd be nice for me to have this
better organized, and partly it's a way to learn more about Emacs
development.

# License

GPL v3.

# Name

It's what my kids call single-serving containers of yogurt.  It seemed
to combine Org, RT and have the all-import two "y" characters.
